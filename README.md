# What's this?

This repository contains the `.xcframework` files associated with High Fidelity's custom version of WebRTC for iOS. This custom framework includes support for stereo audio output, among other features.

Developers are unlikely to require this repository directly. Instead, please check out [our Spatial Audio Client Library for Swift](https://github.com/highfidelity/hifi-spatial-audio-swift), [that library's documentation](https://docs.highfidelity.com/swift/latest/index.html), and [our website](https://highfidelity.com) for more information.
